        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Project 2: 𝐅𝐫𝐚𝐮𝐝 𝐃𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧</h3>
            <p>Description of project 2. Implemented a fraud detection system by analyzing transactional data and identifying anomalous patterns using machine learning algorithms. Collaborated with cross-functional teams to implement real-time monitoring, resulting in a 30% reduction in fraudulent activities and safeguarding financial transactions.</p>
          </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Project 2: 𝐂𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐅𝐫𝐚𝐮𝐝 𝐃𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠</h3>
          <p>Description of project 2. Utilized the 'September 2013 European Cardholder Dataset' with PCA-transformed transaction data to identify fraudulent transactions.
            Conducted data preprocessing to optimize for the application of machine learning algorithms.
            Trained diverse machine learning classification models, including Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression, for fraud prediction, Created a heterogeneous parallel ensemble of models for enhanced fraudulent transaction detection.
            Conducted a thorough comparison of model performance metrics to select the optimal model.
            Tested the final model on a separate dataset, achieving a remarkable 99% accuracy and 94% recall.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Project 2: 𝐅𝐚𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐌𝐍𝐈𝐒𝐓 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐭 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐍𝐞𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐍𝐞𝐭𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐬</h3>
            <p>Description of project 2. Created dataloaders to load the dataset in batches.
                Designed a neural network (using tensorflow) with stem and a backbone where the stem accepts the image data and creates patches, which are processed by the backbone, Trained and tested the neural network which yielded a test accuracy of 79%
                </p>
          </li>
